I am currently an Independent Postdoctoral Fellow at [Simons Center for Computational Physical Chemistry](https://wp.nyu.edu/sccpc/) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). Prior to this, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at Michigan State University, working with Prof. Guowei Wei. I hold a Bachelor's Degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, and an Applied Mathematics Ph.D. from Michigan State University.

My methodological research focuses on the development of mathematical tools for the descriptive and predictive modeling of biomolecules and their interactions. I have also worked on Genomics Analysis, Computational Topology, Drug Discovery, Machine Learning, and Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases.
