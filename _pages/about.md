I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of [Department of Mathematics](https://math.msu.edu/) at [Michgan State Univeristy](https://msu.edu/). My methodological research focuses on the development of mathematical tools for the descriptive and predictive modeling of biomolecules and their interactions. I have also worked on genomics analysis, computational topology, machine learning, and mathematical modeling of infectious diseases. 

I obtained my PhD from Michigan State University, where I was advised by [Prof. Guowei Wei](https://users.math.msu.edu/users/weig/). I hold a Bachelors Degree from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/).
