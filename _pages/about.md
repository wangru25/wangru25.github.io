I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of [Department of Mathematics](https://math.msu.edu/) at [Michgan State University](https://msu.edu/). I completed my PhD from Department of Mathematics at Michigan State University under supervision of [Prof. Guowei Wei](https://users.math.msu.edu/users/weig/) in July 2022. I obtained my Bachelors Degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. 

My methodological research focuses on the development of mathematical tools for the descriptive and predictive modeling of biomolecules and their interactions. I have also worked on Genomics Analysis, Computational Topology, Machine Learning, and Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases.
